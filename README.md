# Flask Weather Analysis for Business Location
## Surfs_up/ Advanced Data Storage

### Overview of Project

Using SQL, Python and Flask for online reach and visualization, this project uses all three tools to explore Advanced Data Storage to retrieve temperatures and perform analyses to find the best time and location to open up a storefront location. 



### Results

* As seen by the graph above, the average temperatures are in the 70s, indicating that a year round ice cream shop would be feasible, as Decemeber on average is only 3 degrees lower than June
* The min value in December, however, is 56 degrees, meaning that some days could receive much lower traffic, with confident forecast, closing the shops on those days could be more economic, which wouldnt have to be often, since the lowest 25th percentile sits at 69 degrees, a very good sign. Days below 60 would be rare outliers
* Overall a good idea, since the 50th and 75th percentile degrees for December are 71 and 74, respectively, meaning a solid warm temperature timeline.

### Summary
  To summarize, it would behoove the entrepreneur to look up the saturation of ice cream shops in Oahu, since the temperatures year round would show a steady, frequent amount of foot traffic. Although low temperature days rarely happen in december, with forecast they predicted and utilized for maintenance and cleaning

 Another two queries to make, is finding the statistics for rain for both months
